We held a token sale in late 2017 and raised $50M from over 10,000 participants.
Registration for this sale is closed and all vouchers have been sent. You can [read a recap about the sale](https://blockstack.org/blog/blockstack-token-sale-recap).

* If you'd like more information, feel free to check out our Token Whitepaper and Token FAQ.
* If you'd like to be added to the waitlist (in case there is another round of vouchers), please [fill out the short form](https://community.blockstack.org/waitlist).

Our token (Stacks Token) will be live sometime in the second half of 2018
(Q3/Q4). Once the network is live, the token sale for unaccredited investors
will begin and vouchers will then be redeemable (up to $3000). More about
distribution - https://blockstack.com/distribution.pdf While you currently can't
purchase more vouchers, there are ways to earn vouchers for tokens today. Learn
