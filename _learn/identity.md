A blockchain identity (or blockchain ID) is a generic term used to refer to any identity on the blockchain. Users can have one blockchain identity or many and can register them just like one would register domain names or accounts on Facebook or Twitter.

The main difference between blockchain identities and accounts on any other service is that blockchain-based systems have strong ownership. Blockchain identities can't be confiscated by any service because the system defines ownership according to ownership of public-private keypairs, just like ownership of coins on Bitcoin. This is in direct contrast to Twitter or Facebook usernames, which could be confiscated or censored at any time by the respective companies that they belong to.

#### Identity on Blockstack

Blockstack is one of the largest, most popular blockchain identity systems, with 80,000 registered identities.

On Blockstack, identities are referred to as "blockstack identities" and they come with profiles and globally unique names.

Profiles can contain both private and public information, which is attested to by the user and can be verified by peers and select authorities.

Identities can be registered for people, companies, websites, software packages, and more.
