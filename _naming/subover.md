BNS names are strongly-owned because the owner of its private key can generate
valid transactions that update its zone file hash and owner.  However, this comes at the
cost of requiring a name owner to pay for the underlying transaction in the
blockchain.  Moreover, this approach limits the rate of BNS name registrations
and operations to the underlying blockchain's transaction bandwidth.

BNS overcomes this with subdomains.  A **BNS subdomain** is a type of BNS name whose state
and owner are stored outside of the blockchain, but whose existence and
operation history are anchored to the
blockchain.  In the example table in the [Resolving BNS
Names](#resolving-bns-names) section, the names `cicero.res_publica.id` and
`podsaveamerica.verified.podcast` are subdomains.

Like their on-chain counterparts, subdomains are globally
unique, strongly-owned, and human-readable.  BNS gives them their own name state
and public keys.

Unlike on-chain names, subdomains can be created and managed
cheaply, because they are broadcast to the
BNS network in batches.  A single blockchain transaction can send up to 120
subdomain operations.

This is achieved by storing subdomain records in the [Atlas Network](atlas_network.md).
An on-chain name owner broadcasts subdomain operations by encoding them as
`TXT` records within a DNS zone file.  To broadcast the zone file,
the name owner sets the new zone file hash with a `NAME_UPDATE` transaction and
replicates the zone file via Atlas.  This, in turn, replicates all subdomain
operations it contains, and anchors the set of subdomain operations to
an on-chain transaction.  The BNS node's consensus rules ensure that only
valid subdomain operations from *valid* `NAME_UPDATE` transactions will ever be
stored.

For example, the name `verified.podcast` once wrote the zone file hash `247121450ca0e9af45e85a82e61cd525cd7ba023`,
which is the hash of the following zone file:

```bash
$ curl -sL https://core.blockstack.org/v1/names/verified.podcast/zonefile/247121450ca0e9af45e85a82e61cd525cd7ba023 | jq -r '.zonefile'

Each `TXT` record in this zone file encodes a subdomain-creation.
For example, `1yeardaily.verified.podcast` resolves to:

```bash
$ curl https://core.blockstack.org/v1/names/1yeardaily.verified.podcast
{
  "address": "1MwPD6dH4fE3gQ9mCov81L1DEQWT7E85qH",
  "blockchain": "bitcoin",

  "status": "registered_subdomain",
  "zonefile_hash": "e7acc97fd42c48ed94fd4d41f674eddbee5557e3",
  "zonefile_txt": "$ORIGIN 1yeardaily\n$TTL 3600\n_http._tcp URI 10 1 \"https://ph.dotpodcast.co/1yeardaily/head.json\"\n"
}
```

This information was extracted from the `1yeardaily` `TXT` resource record in the zone
file for `verified.podcast`.
