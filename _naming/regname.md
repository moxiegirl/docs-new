Registration happens through a BNS client, such as the [Blockstack
Browser](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-browser) or
[blockstack.js](https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack.js).
The reference BNS clients manage a local Bitcoin wallet, calculate transaction fees
dynamically and automatically, and broadcast both the `NAME_PREORDER` and
`NAME_REGISTRATION` transactions at the right times.

If you want to make your own registration client, you should see the
[transaction format](wire-format.md) document.
