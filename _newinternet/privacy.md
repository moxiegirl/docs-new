Internal and Site-Related Usage. We may use and retain any information that we collect on the Site to provide, maintain and improve the Site and our products and services, and to otherwise conduct our business. One of the service providers that we use for data analytics is Google Analytics. If you do not want Google Analytics to collect and use information about your use of the Site, then you can install an opt-out in your web browser	(https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

### Blockstack May Disclose Your Information

We Use Vendors and Service Providers. We may share any information that we receive through the Site with vendors and service providers retained in connection with the provision of the Site.
Marketing. We do not rent, sell, or share personal information (as defined by California Civil Code § 1798.83) collected through the Site about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes, unless we have your permission.

As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures. We may access, preserve, and disclose your information if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (1) comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (2) respond to your requests; or (3) protect your, our or others’ rights, property, or safety.

Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. The use of your information following any of the foregoing events will be governed by the provisions of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information was collected by Blockstack.

Consent. We may also disclose your information with your permission.

### Do Not Track

Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to Do Not Track signals, our Site does not currently respond to such signals.

### Security of Your Information

We use certain physical, organizational, and technical safeguards that are designed to maintain the integrity and security of information that we collect. Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and thus we cannot and do not guarantee that your information will not be accessed, viewed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or organizational safeguards.

### Your Choices and Access

From time to time, we may send marketing e-mail messages to our Users. If you no longer want to receive such emails from us on a going forward basis, then you may opt-out via the “unsubscribe” link provided in each such email.

We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information, as defined by the Federal Trade Commission’s Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Rule, from children under 13 years of age, and no part of the Site is directed to children under the age of 13. If you learn that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, then you may alert us at editors@blockstack.org. If we learn that we have collected any personal information from children under 13, then we will promptly take steps to delete such information.

### International users

New Uses of Information. From time-to-time, we may desire to use information for uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy. If our practices change regarding previously collected information in a way that would be materially less restrictive than stated in the version of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time we collected the information, then we will make reasonable efforts to provide notice and obtain consent to any such uses as may be required by law.
