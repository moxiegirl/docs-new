The Blockstack Authenticator gives users the ability to explore and use the
decentralized applications (dapps). The decentralized applications are a new way
to interact with the internet. Dapps give users control of their data. Data
about them personally, name, birthdate, phone number and data about what they do
such as visiting a website or buying an item.

## Understand the Blockstack Authenticator

Through the Blockstack authemticator application you can create an identity. An identity
represents you as you interact with others through Dapps.  The Blockstack
authenticator is itself, a smiple Dapp. It allows you to:

* create one or more identities
* send and receive bitcoin
* manage the storage of your profile and application data
* find and launch Dapps

There are editions of the Blockstack Authenticator, the web edition is an
application you access through your web browser by simply [visit the
applications' address](https://browser.blockstack.org/) in your computer's
browser.  You can also install the authenticator as a client application on your
computer.

If all you want to do is create, manage, and fund an identity and then interact
with Dapps, you can simply use the web edition. If you have concerns about net
censorship, hightened security concerns, or develop a Dapp yourself, you may
want to download and install the authenticator's client edition.

## Using the Authenticator on public computers

Before you use the web application, it is important to note that once you log
into the application with the brower, your session does not expire until you
choose **Settings > RESET BROWSER**.  For this reason, you should be careful
when using the authenticator on public computers.

If you are in a library, for example, and log into the authenticator, simply
closing the tab or even rebooting the computer does not log you out. Instead,
you should be sure to choose **Settings > RESET BROWSER** before leaving the web
application.

For more information about your identity and the authenticator, see [Get and use a Blockstack IDs](ids-introduction.md).
