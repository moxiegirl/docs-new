Gaia works by hosting data in one or more existing storage systems of the user's choice.
These storage systems are typically cloud storage systems.  We currently have driver support
for S3 and Azure Blob Storage, but the driver model allows for other backend support
as well. The point is, the user gets to choose where their data lives, and Gaia enables
applications to access it via a uniform API.

Blockstack applications use the Gaia storage system to store data on behalf of a user.
When the user logs in to an application, the authentication process gives the application
the URL of a Gaia hub, which performs writes on behalf of that user. The Gaia hub authenticates
writes to a location by requiring a valid authentication token, generated by a private key
authorized to write at that location.
